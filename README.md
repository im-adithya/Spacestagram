## How It Works

- Spacestagram fetches images from 4 different APIs
- The whole process of fetching these requests is too complex, as different APIs have different responses
- For uniformity, these requests are mapped and changed to our convenience.
- Then the data is displayed as images posted by different accounts (one for each API) in your feed.
- This process of data collection is time-consuming, hence the data is stored in localStorage for faster access.
- It also stores your liked and starred posts and shows it (only to you) in your profile!
